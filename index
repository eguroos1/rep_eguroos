Primary Network

With the first Bare metal server or VSI purchase the customer is provisioned with one “Public and private VLAN” and Subnets associated to those VLANs (called “Primary Network”). By default, any Servers are attached to both Public and Private networks using the Public and Private VLANs respectively. 

Private VLAN
Configured in a dedicated physical network enables Private network communication (like Server to Server, Interfacility communication, Network storage, Backend services and Customer Private network)
By default, gateways are assigned in BCR (Backend Customer Router)
IBM Cloud automatically assigns a Subnet ( “Primary network”) with Private VLAN using /26 address pool from 10.0.0.0/8 range

Public VLAN
Configured in a dedicated physical network (physically separated from Private network) enables Public communication through Internet (like VPN to OnPrem or Internet access)
By default, gateways are assigned in FCR (Frontend Customer Router)
Assigned with a subnet of /28 from Public address range (“Primary Network”) by default

Note
Each server will only be allocated “One Primary IP”
Primary IPs cannot be moved unless Server is cancelled
Primary IPs needed for Server management and access to Backend services & Storage
Future Server purchases will be placed on same VLAN (unless full or another VLAN is specified)
Additional VLANs can be purchased through “IBM Cloud Portal” by raising support tickets
Can request for larger Subnet block (> /26) prior to first server being ordered
